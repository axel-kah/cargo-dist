# Guide

dist is focused around *workspaces* - conceptual groupings of projects that exist in the same repository, and which can be built and released together. A workspace can contain just a single project, and the simplest form is easy to get going. If you just want to get going, we recommend checking the [quickstart][way-too-quickstart] guide first.

For users interested in learning more about how workspaces work, and how to put them to work with more complex projects, we recommend starting with our [guide to workspace structure][structure], followed by the [simple guide][simple-guide] which walks you through a simple sample repo and the [complex guide][complex-guide] that introduces a workspace with more complicated features.
