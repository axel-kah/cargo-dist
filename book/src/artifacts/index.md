# Artifacts

dist exists to help you distribute your binaries, which involves generating a lot of different files which we call *Artifacts*. Archives are the baseline artifacts that contain your binaries, and installers are the fancy artifacts that make it easy to install or run the binaries.

* [Archives](./archives.md): tarballs/zips containing your binaries
* [Installers](../installers/index.md): things that help fetch/install archives
* [Checksums](./checksums.md): hashes of other artifacts
* [Symbols](./symbols.md): debuginfo/symbols/sourcemaps of your binaries
